### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate `BubbleRankingIndicator` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'BubbleRankingIndicator'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

In case Xcode complains (<i>"Cannot load underlying module for BubbleRankingIndicator"</i>) go to Product and choose Clean (or simply press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>).

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate `BubbleRankingIndicator` into your project manually.

<a name="usage"> Usage </a>
--------------

`BubbleRankingIndicator` is state based. To configure the view, simply update the state value with whatever values you'd like, and re-set the state:

1) First you should set up the `BubbleRankingIndicator`:

```swift
var bubbleRankingIndicatorView = BubbleRankingIndicatorView()

var state = bubbleRankingIndicatorView.state
var ranks = [Rank]()
// Create and initialize all of the Ranks. These can be changed later.
state.ranks = ranks
state.unachievedRankBackgroundColor = .lightGray
state.rankNameFont = .systemFont(ofSize: 30)

bubbleRankingIndicatorView.state = state
```

2) In order to set the active rank, modify the `state` object:

```swift

var state = bubbleRankingIndicatorView.state
state.activeRankLevel = 2
bubbleRankingIndicatorView.state = state
```
